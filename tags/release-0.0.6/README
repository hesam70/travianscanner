travianscanner:
A multi-thread tool for scan travian map to search
farm, oasis, village. Help you find out which village
is out of maintenance, which grid has 15 fields of farm,
etc. It's version 0.0.6 now, and support Chinese servers
only(s1-s4.travian.cn), and we'll make it i18n and support
all travian servers around the world.

Do not abuse it cause it will cost a lot of network
resource or make game server busy if too many user
use it at the same time. So you should only scan
grids near your home.
