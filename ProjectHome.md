# What is travianscanner #
A multi-thread tool for scan [travian](http://www.travian.cn) map for farm, oasis, village. Help you find out which village is out of maintenance, which grid has 15 fields of farm, etc.
It's version 0.0.3 now, and support Chinese servers only(s1-s4.travian.cn), and we'll make it i18n and support all travian servers around the world.

Do not abuse it cause it will cost a lot of network resource or make game server busy if too many user use it at the same time. So you should only scan grids near your home in the game.

# 0.0.6 released #
I published a package for WIN32, including an exe file.
Linux user or other platform can using [svn](http://code.google.com/p/travianscanner/source) to check out the latest version.
